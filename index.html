        <p> 
        Hello, My name is William Ottenbreit, I am a grade 11 student at Holy Trinity Academy.
        I Became interested in coding in grade 8 beause my older brother was studying compmuter science and I had already done a little bit in elementary school.
        Over the past few years I have developed an intrest in programming.
        The languages I have focussed on are C++, HTML, JS, CSS, and ti-Basic, and have touched into TypeScript and scratch.
        I have used these languages to mess arund with an aruino a little bit, and make small games, simulations, etc..
        The reason that I enjoy coding is because I like solving problems and seeing something that I typed come to life.
        This portfolio has been designed to represent my current skills and to help me find a part time job or paid internship coding so that I can develope my skills.
        </p>

            <p>Here's a link to my now abandoned scratch account: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Maillait/">Maillait-Scratch</a></p>
            <p>Quick disclamer: I have learnt a decent amount about making code look nice and readable since I stopped work on my other 2 repositories. But feel free to look at them.</p>
