        <p> 
        Hello, My name is William Ottenbreit, and I am a grade 11 student at Holy Trinity Academy.
        In grade 8 I became interrested in programming beause my older brother was studying computer science and I had already done a little bit of scratch in elementary school.
        The languages I have focused on are C++, HTML, JS, CSS, and ti-Basic, but have touched into TypeScript and scratch.
        I have used these languages to mess arund with an arduino, make small games, simulations, etc..
        The reason that I enjoy coding is because I like solving problems and seeing something that I typed come to life.
        This portfolio has been designed to represent my current skills and to help me find a part time job or paid internship coding so that I can develop my skills.
        </p>
