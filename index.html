      <h2>--About--</h2> 
      <p> Hello, I first began programming in grade 5, with scratch. I stayed on using scratch, with small jaunts<br>
        into typescript and CPP(for an arduino) until grade 10, when I began to learn CPP and Ti-basic more formally. Since<br>
        then I've also learnt HTML, CSS, and JS, as demonstrated in this portfolio.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "example" class = "section">
      <h2>--Examples--</h2>
      <div style = "display:flex">
        <p>Here's a link to my now abandoned scratch account: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Maillait/">Maillait-Scratch</a></p>
        <p>feel free to look at github projects, they use the canves element,<br>
          and are somewhat spaggetti. Since then I have learnt better on local file systems.</p>
       </div>
       <p>Here are some pictures of my CPP console applications and Ti-basic programs:</p>
